ðŸ“¦ Task 1 â€“ CI/CD Pipeline Using AWS CodePipeline and Terraform
ðŸ“‹ Overview
This task sets up a complete CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, fully provisioned and managed through Terraform. It automates the process from source code changes to application deployment, reducing manual effort and improving consistency.

ðŸš€ Pipeline Components
The pipeline includes the following stages:

Source: Connects to a GitHub repository to track code changes.

Build: Uses AWS CodeBuild to compile and prepare the application.

Deploy: Delivers the built application using AWS CodeDeploy or EC2.

ðŸ”§ Infrastructure Provisioned
All infrastructure is defined and deployed using Terraform, including:

AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy

S3 buckets for storing pipeline artifacts

IAM roles and policies required for secure access and execution

âœ… Validation
Infrastructure tests were written using Terratest to ensure:

Proper creation of resources

Correct configurations of pipeline stages

Secure and expected behavior of IAM policies

ðŸ“Œ Outcome
The pipeline was successfully deployed and tested, forming a solid foundation for continuous integration and delivery workflows. It ensures a repeatable, scalable, and secure DevOps environment ready for further extension.
